    <h2>Egyptian Yellow Lentil Soup Recipe</h2>
    <p>Egyptian yellow lentil soup, also known as "shorbat ads" in Arabic, is a comforting and nutritious soup made from yellow lentils, commonly enjoyed in Egypt and throughout the Middle East. This soup is simple to prepare yet packed with flavor, making it a perfect dish for cooler days or whenever you're craving a hearty and satisfying meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried yellow lentils, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 large potato, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>6 cups vegetable or chicken broth (or water)</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for sautéing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Sauté the Aromatics: </b>Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until translucent and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Add the Lentils and Vegetables: </b>Add the rinsed lentils, diced carrot, and diced potato to the pot. Stir to combine with the onions and garlic.</li>
        <li><b>Season the Soup: </b>Add the ground cumin, turmeric, coriander, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir well to coat the vegetables and lentils with the spices.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the Soup: </b>Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth (or water) into the pot, ensuring that the lentils and vegetables are fully submerged. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, partially covered, for about 20-25 minutes or until the lentils and vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li><b>Blend the Soup <i>(Optional)</i>: </b>For a smooth and creamy texture, use an immersion blender to purée the soup directly in the pot until smooth. Alternatively, transfer a portion of the soup to a blender and blend until smooth, then return it to the pot.</li>
        <li><b>Finish and Serve! </b>Stir in the freshly squeezed lemon juice, adjusting the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Ladle the hot yellow lentil soup into bowls and serve immediately, garnished with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of ground cumin or paprika if desired.</li>
